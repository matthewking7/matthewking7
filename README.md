Matthew King (he/him)

Welcome to my Github profile!

I am a third-year Biology student ar Stonehill College. I am interested in research in mircrobiology. 

I plan to work as a representative for a pharmaceutical company who will explain how new drugs work at hospitals who have purchased the new drug!

In my profile, check out my Function Tutorial project to see the skills I have in R that I tied in with my personal interests! You should also check out "King_Week7" as it was my favorite assignment that focused on loops in R.
